# 🧠 Pain Detection System using Deep Learning (ResNet-18)

A deep learning-based system that detects **pain intensity from facial expressions** using **ResNet-18**, trained on the **UNBC-McMaster Shoulder Pain Expression Dataset**. The system supports both image uploads and live camera input, provides **real-time predictions**, and features **text-to-speech (TTS)** feedback for accessibility.

## 📌 Project Highlights

- ✅ Real-time pain intensity detection (None, Mild, Moderate, Severe)
- 📷 Supports webcam and image upload via browser
- 🧠 Built with PyTorch + Flask + JavaScript
- 🔊 Includes TTS module for spoken feedback
- 📈 Achieves 88% accuracy with MAE ~0.04
- 🗃️ Dataset: 48K+ labeled facial images
- 🌐 Fully interactive and deployable web interface

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1️⃣ Environment Setup

Make sure you have **Python 3.8+** installed.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install required libraries
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 2️⃣ Dataset Setup

Organize your dataset as follows after downloded it from the given link in the dataset_details folder:

```plaintext
data/
├── images/Images/           # Subfolders of images per class
├── labels/PSPI/             # PSPI label text files per image
```

OR simply run the download script:

```bash
python dataset_details/downloadData.py
```

---

### 3️⃣ Data Preparation

Process and validate image-label pairs, then split into train/val/test:

```bash
python scripts/prepare_data.py
```

---

### 4️⃣ Train the Model

Train the ResNet-18 model using preprocessed data:

```bash
python scripts/train_model.py
```

The model will be saved at `app/model/model.pt`.

---

### 5️⃣ Run the Web Application

Launch the Flask server:

```bash
python server.py
```

Open your browser and navigate to: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

---

## 🎥 Demo

> A sample UI demonstration video is provided under `Sample_system_video/`.

---

## 🧪 Custom Training

To train on a new dataset:

1. Replace image/label folders under `data/`
2. Update download links in `dataset_details/Dataset_Details.txt` (if applicable)
3. Run:

   ```bash
   python scripts/prepare_data.py
   python scripts/train_model.py
   ```
